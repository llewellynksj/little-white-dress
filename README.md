# Little White Dress

Little White Dress (LWD) is a website developed as part of a Portfolio Project for my Full Stack Software Development course delivered by Code Institute. The idea was born out of a real-world need; a close friend who is a wedding planner with a dream to open their own wedding dress store.

A visitor to the LWD website can easily browse the products on sale, make a booking to attend the store and try on dresses, and join a community of brides who share recommendations.

## Features

### **Accessibility**
In addition to being best practice, having an accessible website is extremely high on the list of requirements for the target audience. Close attention has been paid to the following in order to ensure the site is as accessible as possible:
- Clear and simple font styling, avoiding any cursive or calligraphic scripts.
- Contrasting colour scheme, but avoiding colours that are too bold.
- Use of semantic HTML
- Ensuring all images have an alt description for screen readers or where the image cannot be loaded. Also ensuring that these are as descriptive as possible.
